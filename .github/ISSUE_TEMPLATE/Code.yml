        ### Thank you for your bug report!
        
        Please, understand that code issues are reserved for real, reproducible pagy bugs.
        
        _If you are not sure that your problem is actually a bug,
        please ask for [support](https://github.com/ddnexus/pagy/discussions/categories/q-a) instead._

        ### IMPORTANT!
        
        **The issue MUST provide a code file confirming the bug AND complying with the list below
        OR it will be automatically closed!**
        
        
        #### VALID code files 
        
        
        - Edited copy of a single-file APP from the [Pagy Playground](https://ddnexus.github.io/pagy/playground) 
        
        - Link to a pagy fork containing an added test file

        - A plain ruby file that can run as a single command like `ruby my_issue.rb`
        _(without any other setup step, installation or guessing, and with no or minimal interaction required)_
        
        
        #### INVALID "code" 


        - EVERYTHING other than the above! 
        
        - Totally useless things like (but not limited to):
        
          - Code snippets
        
          - Multiple files
        
          - Complex setup
        
          - Complete applications
        
          - Any description of errors generated by running your own code
        
          - Rationalizations about "WHY" and "WHAT" you think it's a bug
        
        
        Please, understand that we won't guess your environment/usage/configuration/conflicts out of some snippet
        or description, nor clone/install/setup/debug your complete application.
        
        
        Please, start from a [pagy APP](https://ddnexus.github.io/pagy/playground/#pagy-apps)
        and add the minimum that makes it fail. It's a very simple process and, most of the times,
        it will make your issue just "disappear". ;)
        
        
        _If anything is unclear to you, please ask for [support](https://github.com/ddnexus/pagy/discussions/categories/q-a).
        We will be happy to help._
