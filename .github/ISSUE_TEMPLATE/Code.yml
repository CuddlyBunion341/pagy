        ### IMPORTANT!
        
        **The issue MUST provide a code file confirming the bug AND complying with the list below
        OR it will be automatically closed!**
        
        
        #### Valid code files 
        
        
        - Edited copy of the single file [repro.ru](https://ddnexus.github.io/pagy/try-it/#2-reproru) <<< **RECOMMENDED!** 
        
        - Edited copy of the single file [pagy_bare_rails.rb](https://github.com/ddnexus/pagy/blob/master/apps/pagy_bare_rails.rb)
        
        - Link to a pagy fork containing an added test file

        - A plain ruby file that can run as a single command `ruby my-problem.rb` 
        _(without any other setup step, installation or guessing, and with no or minimal interaction required)_
        
        
        If anything is unclear to you, please ask for [support](https://github.com/ddnexus/pagy/discussions/categories/q-a). We will be happy to help.
