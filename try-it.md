# Pagy Executable

We added a small `pagy` executable that can run browser-demos from the installed gem: no need to setup
anything on your side!

!!!success Try it now!

Run the interactive demo from your terminal:

```sh
pagy run demo
# or bundle exec pagy run demo (depending on your env)
```

...and point your browser to http://0.0.0.0:8000
!!!

### Demo Apps

At the moment we have a couple of single-file sinatra apps ready to run in your brower...

#### 1. Demo.ru

An interactive showcase of all the helpers and styles.

Available with `pagy run demo` (or `bundle exec pagy run demo`). You can use it to check the look and the functionalities of 
all the components of the different styles.

#### 2. Repro.ru

A minimalistic app that you can use as a starting point for prototyping or reproducing issues, in order
to get support or file bugs reports.

||| Create a new `repro.ru` app

```sh
pagy create repro
```

You should find the `./repro.ru` new app file in the current dir. Feel free to rename or move it as you like.

|||
||| Develop it

This command runs a puma server that logs and auto-restart your app when it changes:

```sh
pagy develop path/to/your/renamed-repro.ru
```

Point a browser to `http://0.0.0.0:8000`

Edit it at will.
