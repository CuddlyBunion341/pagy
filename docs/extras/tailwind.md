# Tailwind Style

Tailwind allows to apply styles to any DOM element, so you don't actually need any special extra to produce a different output.
You can use the standard pagy helpers and `@apply` the tailwind classes by just using the [pagy.tailwind.scss](../api/stylesheets/#pagy-tailwind-scss) stylesheet file.
